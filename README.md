# ETER: Workshop Repo

This repo contains all the info about the workshop we are developing with the community. 

The *aim* of this workshop is that participants learn about open source tools and methodology, and that they apply it by building an open source air quality monitor.

You can find the general workshop plan [here](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter-workshop/blob/master/WorkshopPlan_ES.md)

The workshop has *6 sessions* or 'chapters'. There's a folder for each one, containing the plan, resources and any other relevant information for that session.

As this material is being developed with the community, *it's almost 100% in Spanish*. Translations are welcome! :D
