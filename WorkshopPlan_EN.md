# SHEET TO COMPLETE STUDY GROUP DATA

## GROUP TITLE
Title: Open and community science projects
Subtitle: Colaborative design of a Free air quality Monitor

## DESCRIPTION
Open science means to openly and colaboratively produce scientific knowledge, leaving freely available not only the work instruments but also the intermediate and final results obtained during this process. This way of doing science changes the scientific knowledge production because it is more efficient, democratic and has the potential to better meet social demands.
The case we are going to take as a practice to learn to do open science starts with the idea that air pollution is an invisible thread that affects the health of 80% of the population in urban centers like Buenos Aires. In 2016, the WHO classified Buenos Aires as one of the cities that exceed the limit of 10 μg/m3 for particulate material less than 2.5 microns, highly harmful to human health. Despite that, public information about air quality in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area is non-existent. Private measurements are expensive and inaccessible, and data is difficult to read.
Our goal is to reflect and learn about the methodology that will lead us to build a device to measure the quality of the air (PM2.5 and PM10), based on the MACA Project. We do this together with teachers of José León Suárez, community leaders and all those interested in collaborating with the generation of free educational materials so that the experience can be reproduced.
We think that people have to know which are the available tools that can help them make visible and find solutions to their everyday problems. By combining low cost sensors available in the market with the ethics and philosophy of free software, we want to show how free tools can be built that are useful for people.
