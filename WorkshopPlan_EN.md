# SHEET TO COMPLETE STUDY GROUP DATA

## GROUP TITLE
Title: Open and community science projects
Subtitle: Colaborative design of a Free air quality Monitor

## DESCRIPTION
Open science means to openly and colaboratively produce scientific knowledge, leaving freely available not only the work instruments but also the intermediate and final results obtained during this process. This way of doing science changes the scientific knowledge production because it is more efficient, democratic and has the potential to better meet social demands.
The case we are going to take as a practice to learn to do open science starts with the idea that air pollution is an invisible thread that affects the health of 80% of the population in urban centers like Buenos Aires. In 2016, the WHO classified Buenos Aires as one of the cities that exceed the limit of 10 μg/m3 for particulate material less than 2.5 microns, highly harmful to human health. Despite that, public information about air quality in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area is non-existent. Private measurements are expensive and inaccessible, and data is difficult to read.
